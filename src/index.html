                <p>Antonio Canova’s statue The Three Graces is a Neoclassical sculpture, in marble, of the mythological three Charites, daughters of Zeus – identified on some engravings of the statue as, from left to right, Euphrosyne, Aglaea and Thalia
                    – who were said to represent youth/beauty (Thalia), mirth (Euphrosyne), and elegance (Aglaea). The Graces presided over banquets and gatherings, to delight the guests of the gods.</p>

                <h1>The Story</h1>
                <p>The Graces were the subject of cult worship across the Greek world, but especially southern Greece and Asia Minor. They were particularly important at Orchomenus in Arcadia where they had an annual festival, the Charitesia, held in their
                    honour. Pausanias mentions that they were there associated with meteorites or shooting stars.<br><br> The historian goes on to list various names of Graces at different cities, for example, Auxo and Hegemone at Athens, and Kleta and
                    Phaenna at Sparta. These were no doubt local deities incorporated into the wider Greek cult of the Graces. In Athens, from the 3rd century BCE, the Graces and Aphrodite were linked to Demos, the personification of the people as attested
                    by an inscribed altar.</p>
